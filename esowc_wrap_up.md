Over the previous three months I have been lucky enough to work with my friend and colleague Gabriel (Gabi) Tseng, under the mentorship of ECMWF with support from my PhD Supervisors here at Oxford.

We have developed a fully unit-tested pipeline that goes from data download to analysing the predictions made by various machine learning models. There have been innumerable learnings through this process. I am extremely excited about the work to come because we have an incredible tool that we can ask and (hopefully) answer lots of questions with.

My personal goals when I set out on this project were as follows:
1) Become acquainted with machine learning libraries like Pytorch.
2) Practice my software engineering skills, particularly around github and unit testing.
3) Apply machine learning to drought science.
4) Contribute to an awesome piece of software that I can continue to use into the future.

While the technical aspects have been important there is also a human story that I want to emphasise.

I met Gabi through a GitHub project that we had both forked. After an [initial experiment]() run over a month or so, we came across the ECMWF Summer of Weather Code project and decided we ought to apply. At this point we were relative strangers but Gabi's keenness and drive meant that we had a pretty awesome submission. This vigor continued throughout the three months of the Summer project. I now know what it means to succesfully work together with someone else on a shared project. !![It feels like we worked incredibly well together], our skills were complementary and we had a similar drive to achieve with the project. Despite being on opposite sides of the Atlantic, Gabi in Canada and myself in Oxford, collaborating was a breeze. 

Let's innovate together!

On top of that I have had the support of someone extremely special who pushes me to be better every day.
