Presentation:
- what changes to the gradient descent algorithm (the R ADAM stuff)
- add a legend to the spatial plots in the plot+histograms
- up to us what bits we want to emphasise
- broad overview of the pipeline
- shap values explanation on the slides
- see the results and the SHAP values
- asking questions of the performance
    - some analysis of why performance is better or worse?
- See the pipeline & OUTPUTS (what can we now do with the pipeline)
- get people excited enough to come and see our repository

Notebooks:
- they were relatively happy and will go through and have a look
- We need to sort the environment.yml file

Phi Week
- Tuesday deadline
- AIM: spark interest and get people to github

AI for Copernicus data
- November 4th - 8th
- would like us to present there too!
- what we did during the summer of weather code & what we found

Going forwards
- they are keen to continue to work together and hope that we do keep working on teh pipeline
- to use the pipeline to address the performance of these ML models against GLOFAS for example (streamflow / hydrological droughts)
