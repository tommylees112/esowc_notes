Caroline Dunning
----------------
- onset / termination dates
- ASK for the code

Callum Munday
--------------
- water variability transport (atmospheric rivers)
- instance of droughts in Ethiopia/Kenya

where is it happening?
- easterly travelling westward from the indian ocean
Why is it happening there?
- TOPOGRAPHY
- turkana low leve jet = 30% of water vapour transport along the
- variability in the Turkana channel

What impact of Turkana jet
- when turkana strong have a tendency towards drought
- subsidence, suppressed rainfall etc.
- drier conditions across E.Africa / Wetter conditions in Congo
- climate models dont do great

(how does the jet change with ENSO / SSTs)
(how spatially variable are the )

!Q [
    DMacleod = MJO impact on rainfall variability
    - models for MJO existence and propogation
    - through indonesia / west pacific
    - ECMWF doing the best at reproducing the MJO in the models
]

Linda Hirons = Impala/Swift
------------
- s2s work (MAM - M and M predictable, A is les predictable )
- models with winds (mean state) going the wrong way across the Indian ocean have greater precipitation biases
- mean state in the Indian Ocean
    - reducing the ensemble of mean state models do we get better estimation of the rains?
- Africa PEG 29th October (message Linda or Caroline)

Declan Finney -> HyCristal at Leeds
-------------
- strong jet = increase rainfall
- weak jet = weaken rainfall
- NonParameterised Convection vs. Parameterised Convection
    - CP4 model @4km resolution
    -

Dave Macleod -> FORPAC
-------------
- early warning systems
- NDMA and Kenyan Red Cross
- urban flooding in Nairobi,
- drought in Kitui county

MAM Long Rains 2018
- flash flooding/event
- how predictable was this event?
- GHACOF // KMD // GPC forecast
- use forecasts to clear drains and bridges etc.
- Looking at the rainfall each day in a season (MAM)
    - 1) not continuous rain very sporadic with multiple events
    - 2) associated with MJO
    - 3) associated with tropical storm at Madagascar
- MJO zones and the observed rains vs. true rains
- 6 weeks 2x week forecast (sub-seasonal)

Give warnings ahead by 4 weeks! (they can work)

Elisabeth Thompson -> SWIFT
------------------
- S2S database = a test bed for operational production
- of weekly forecasts
- Probabilistic and determinstic rainfall
    - dry spell product
    - accumulated rainfall product

Felipe -> SWIFT
-------------
- too long to be influenced by initial conditions
- too short to be influenced by boundary conditions
- s2s database
    - compare multiple scores
    - MSSS vs. Correlation (for understanding ensemble means)
    - RPSS (mse for probability)
    - ROC Curve
    - Reliability diagram
- ENSO / IOD / MJO (active, inactive, very active)
- MAM vs. OND

Different verification methods
Different attributes of forecast quality
Forecast better 2 weeks about

Matt Young @ Reading TAMSAT
----------
- seasonal forecast information
- spatial variability of seasonal rainfall
- look at the performance of Tercile forecasts (GHACOF models)
- identify heterogenous / homogenous regions of rainfall

Joseph Mutemi - circulation attributes in E.African weather & climate
--------------

Ellen Dyer
----------
- diagnostics for cmip5 models (how test how well the models are doing)
- moisture flux convergence is a good proxy for RAINFALL
- sub seasonal diagnostics
    (combine lower scale and higher scale)
    (two connected diagnostics )
- agriculture vs. water allocation (different applications of model ability)

Geoffrey Sabiti - HyCRISTAL
---------------
- model evaluation and diagnostics
- metrics vs. process based evaluation
- why are coupled models drier than atmosphere only models?

Meron Teferi-Taye (Ellen Dyer)
-----------------
- Lower Awash (Indian ocean, Atlantic and Mediterranean)
- Upper Awash (Paific SSTs)
- climate information on small climate scale

Laura Burgin
------------
- making stories
- "the year is 2050. In Cape Town the rainfall is currently [x]% of 2019 levels"

Andrea Ficchi
-------------
- forecast based financing (release hte funds as soon as possible)
    - trade offs of false positives (giving money when not required)
    - vs. false negatives (not giving money when required)
- Probabilistic flood forecasting (using GLOFAS)
- 51 ensemble member inputs through GLOFAS -> 51 predictions of the
- https://www.forecast-based-financing.org/projects/uganda/
- win-win in giving out resources so doesn't matter if they
