Droughts describe a persistent lack of water that can lead to destruction of agriculture, a loss of ecosystem services, reduced transporation and energy generation. It is estimated that droughts cause 22% of global damages due to natural hazards. Drought events are likely to become more frequent and intense under future climate scenarios. Recent decades have seen increasingly severe events in East Africa.

This work looks at drought monitoring and prediction using different statistical forecasting techniques. We have built a climate data preprocessing pipeline that takes in arbitrary climate and satellite derived inputs and converts them to a universal data format. This allows multiple models to be tested. I want to explore the use of Stan for building principled statistical models and would appreciate sharing the pipeline and our current findings in order to engage the Stan community in how best to proceed.

This work forms part of my PhD and is sponsored by the Natural Environment Research Council and the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF).
